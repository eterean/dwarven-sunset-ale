			<p>The cosmic force of order has suffused you with magic. That power arises from Mechanus or a realm like it-a plane of existence shaped entirely by clockwork efficiency. You, or someone from your lineage, might have become entangled in the machinations of the modrons, the orderly beings who inhabit Mechanus. Perhaps your ancestor even took part in the Great Madron March. Whatever its origin within you, the power of order can seem strange to others, but for you, it is part of a vast and glorious system.</p>
