			<h5>FIGHTING STYLE OPTIONS</h5>
			<p><em>1st-level fighter feature</em></p>
			<p>When you choose a fighting style, the following styles are added to your list of options.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">BLIND FIGHTING</h5>
			<p>You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">INTERCEPTION</h5>
			<p>When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">SUPERIOR TECHNIQUE</h5>
			<p>You learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).</p>
			<p>You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">THROWN WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
			<p>You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.</p>
			<p>In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">UNARMED FIGHTING</h5>
			<p>Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.</p>
			<p>At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.</p>

Add your proficiency bonus to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals the hit point number in its stat block or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher. Like any creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest to regain hit points.</p>
			<p class="indent">The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Help action.

		<description>			
            <p><em>3rd-level ranger feature, which replaces the Ranger's Companion feature</em></p>
			<p>You magically summon a primal beast, which draws strength from your bond with nature. The beast is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. Choose its stat block-Beast of the Land, Beast of the Sea, or Beast of the Sky-which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You also determine the kind of animal the beast is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block. Whatever kind you choose, the beast bears primal markings, indicating its mystical origin.</p>
			<p class="indent">In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to take the Attack action. If you are incapacitated, the beast can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the beast has died within the last hour, you can use your action to touch it and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The beast returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you finish a long rest, you can summon a different primal beast. The new beast appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, and you choose its stat block and appearance. If you already have a beast from this feature, it vanishes when the new beast appears. The beast also vanishes if you die.</p>

			<description>In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, the only action it takes is the Dodge action until you spend your bonus action or one of your attacks to command it. If died within last hr, spend a 1st level or higher spell slot to revive it full hit points after 1 minute.</description>
