			<p>Your soul isn’t your own or, at least, it wasn’t always yours. Whether you’ve lived past lives, your soul was swapped into a different body, or you have a link connecting you to another being, you experience echoes from another life. These echoes grant you knowledge, talents, or even languages you can’t always explain, but they also intrude on your perceptions and beliefs unexpectedly.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Intrusive Echoes.</em></strong> Immediately after you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, your soul’s memories emerge and overtake your perceptions and experiences. You might see people around you as someone other than who they are, or you become disoriented by a double-experience of the world around you.

			<p>You are haunted by spiritual beings, whether the souls of the departed or entities from another plane. Their voices endlessly whisper, taunt, or cajole, sometimes rising to unearthly howls. Only you can perceive the spirits, unless you allow them to speak through you. The spirits are intangible and invisible; anyone who can see invisible creatures sees only fleeting glimpses of these spirits as they haunt you.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spirit Whispers.</em></strong> You learn the message cantrip if you don’t already know it, and require no components to cast it. When you cast the spell, the messages are delivered by one of your whispering spirits rather than you or the target’s voice. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice when you gain this Dark Gift).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sudden Cacophony.</em></strong> When you are hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to channel your haunting spirits, letting their voices howl through you. If the attacker isn’t deafened, add your proficiency bonus to your AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. Once this trait causes an attack to miss, you can’t use the trait again until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Voices from Beyond.</em></strong> Immediately after you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, the haunting voices grow too loud to ignore.

		<description>
			<p>The shadow you cast is animate and ever-present, even when lighting conditions would otherwise prevent it. Your shadow occasionally moves out of sync with you. Sometimes it appears to be undertaking random but mundane tasks, while at other times it acts out your darker impulses, threatening or even attacking other shadows. With effort, you can bend this shadow puppetry to your will.</p>
			<p class="indent">Roll on or choose an option from the Shadow Quirk table to determine how your living shadow behaves. Additionally, you gain the traits that follow.</p>

				<tr><td>4</td><td>My shadow’s movements mirror mine incorrectly—when I raise my left hand, my shadow moves its right.</td></tr>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Grasping Shadow.</em></strong> You learn the mage hand cantrip if you don’t already know it, and require no components to cast it. The hand created by the spell is shadowy but is not bound to your actual shadow. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice when you gain this Dark Gift).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Shadow Strike.</em></strong> When you make a melee attack roll, you can increase your reach for that attack by 10 feet. Your shadow stretches and delivers the attack as if it were you. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ominous Will.</em></strong> Immediately after you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, your shadow exerts a will of its own and might assist or hinder you or those around you. The next time you or a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, roll a d4. If the number is odd, reduce the total by the number rolled. If the number is even, increase the total by the number rolled. Once this effect occurs, it can’t happen again until you 􀂦nish a short or long rest.</p>

			<p>The Mists grip all who tread the Domains of Dread, but you know how to slip through their grasp. You can navigate the Mists successfully given enough time and a little luck, but this freedom comes with a price; if you remain in one area for too long, the Mists find you and drain your life force.</p>
			<p class="indent">Roll on or choose an option from the Misty Travels table to determine how you developed this Dark Gift. Additionally, you gain the traits that follow.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Misty Step.</em></strong> You can cast the misty step spell, requiring no spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it this way again. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice when you gain this Dark Gift). If you have spell slots of 2nd level or higher, you can cast this spell with them.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Misty Traveler.</em></strong> When you enter the Mists intent on reaching a specific domain, you are treated as if you possess a Mist talisman keyed to that domain. To use this trait, you must know the name of the domain you have chosen as your destination, but you don’t need to have previously visited that land. This trait doesn’t allow you to bypass domain borders closed by a Darklord’s will.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Poisoned Roots.</em></strong> When you 􀂦nish a long rest, the world around you in a 10-mile radius becomes a siphon that will eventually leech away your vitality. You can remain in the area safely for a number of weeks equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 week). Thereafter, each time you finish a long rest in the area, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion that can’t be removed while you remain in the area.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Transformation.</em></strong> You can cast the alter self spell to appear in your second form. When you do so, you gain the effects of that spell’s Change Appearance option and cannot end it to gain the bene􀂦ts of a different option. Casting alter self in this way requires no spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it this way again. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice when you gain this Dark Gift). If you have spell slots of 2nd level or higher, you can cast this spell with them.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you cast alter self using this feature, some cosmetic aspect of your second form remains after the spell ends. This visibly marks you unless you actively hide or disguise it. The mark is a perceptible change such as scaly skin, stunted wings, eyes without pupils, or horns. The mark fades after you 􀂦nish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Involuntary Change.</em></strong> Certain circumstances can activate your Dark Gift. After you experience this catalyst, at the start of your next turn you must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or use your action to cast alter self as described in the Transformation trait, even if you have already used it.</p>

		<description>
			<p>A second being resides within your body along with you. It manifests physically somewhere on you and relies on you for its survival. At the same time, it offers you knowledge and other assistance, either of its own volition or because of your intertwined nature. The symbiote has its own personality and agenda, which might be at odds with yours. If you ignore the symbiote’s desires, it might strive to interfere with you. There is no way to be rid of the symbiote while you have this Dark Gift. Even if you go to drastic lengths, such as severing the part of your body where the symbiote resides, it reappears on your body in another location at the next midnight.</p>
			<p class="indent">Roll on or choose an option from the Symbiotic Nature table to determine what sort of symbiotic being shares your body. Additionally, you gain the traits that follow.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Symbiotic Nature</h5>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>d6</td><td>Symbiote</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>1</td><td>Tiny humanoid facial features protruding from your torso, palm, or the back of your head</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>An alien appendage inside an unhealing wound</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>A burrowing, worm-like being</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>An intrusive thought that inhabits your mind</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>A living tattoo</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>Crystal growths that replace a portion of your body</td></tr>
			</table>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Entwined Existence.</em></strong> Your symbiote is a separate entity with its own physical form bound to yours. It isn’t a separate creature and relies on you to survive. It has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The DM sets the symbiote’s abilities or determines them randomly (roll 4d6 for each score, ignoring the lowest roll and totaling the rest). The symbiote can see and hear using your senses.</p>
			<p class="indent">The symbiote speaks, reads, and understands two languages; one that you speak, as well as one appropriate to its nature. Choose one of the following skills: Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Religion, Perception, or Persuasion. You gain proficiency in that skill if you don’t already have it, representing the symbiote’s counsel and guidance.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you die, so does your symbiote. If you are subsequently returned to life, your symbiote revives as well.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sustained Symbiosis.</em></strong> Your symbiote has a vested interest in your survival and takes steps to ensure it. When you fail a saving throw, you can choose to have your symbiote expend one of your Hit Dice to roll it and add the number rolled to the saving throw, potentially turning the failure into a success. If it uses this feature on a death saving throw, you succeed on the save and regain 1 hit point regardless of the number rolled on the d20.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you succeed on a saving throw due to this trait, the symbiote can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Symbiotic Agenda.</em></strong> Your symbiote has an agenda that drives it, and it expects you to assist it in achieving those goals. How permissive or patient it is in resolving its agenda depends on its personality (work with your DM to determine these details). If you have an opportunity to advance its agenda and don’t act on it, the symbiote can try to force your hand. You must succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 + the symbiote’s Charisma modifier) or be charmed by the symbiote for 1d12 hours. While charmed, you must try to follow the symbiote’s commands. If you take damage that is not self-inflicted, you can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.</p>
			<p class="indent">Roll or choose from the Symbiotic Agenda table to determine the symbiote’s goal, working with your DM to detail the speci􀂦cs or create another agenda.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Symbiotic Agenda</h5>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>d6</td><td>Agenda</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>1</td><td>The symbiote seeks to destroy a specific type of being, such as fiends, trolls, or paladins.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>The symbiote craves knowledge and is determined to solve a mystery or learn a secret.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>The symbiote wants to bring a prophecy to fruition or to thwart one.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>The symbiote seeks to defend the servants and interests of a powerful being or organization.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>The symbiote wants to keep you from harm at all costs and believes it knows what’s best for you.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>The symbiote seeks to experience new sensations, the more bizarre the better.</td></tr>

		<description>
			<p>A dire wolf tooth dangles from this simple cord necklace. While you wear it, the necklace grants you a +1 bonus to ability checks and saving throws.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> Attuning to Harkon’s Bite curses you until either Harkon Lukas removes the necklace from you or you are targeted by a remove curse spell or similar magic. As long as you remain cursed, you cannot remove the necklace.</p>
			<p class="indent">Upon donning or removing the necklace, whether you are attuned to it or not, you are afflicted with werewolf lycanthropy as detailed in the Monster Manual. The curse lasts until the dawn after the next full moon. If you are still wearing the necklace at this time, you are afflicted with the lycanthropy again.</p>
