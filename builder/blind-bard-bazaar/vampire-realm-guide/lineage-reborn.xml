			<p class="flavor">Death isn’t always the end. The reborn exemplify this, being individuals who have died yet, somehow, still live. Some reborn exhibit the scars of fatal ends, their ashen flesh or bloodless veins making it clear that they’ve been touched by death. Other reborn are marvels of magic or science, being stitched together from disparate beings or bearing mysterious minds in manufactured bodies. Whatever their origins, reborn know a new life and seek experiences and answers all their own.</p>            
			<h4>FADED MEMORIES</h4>
			<p>Reborn suffer from some manner of discontinuity, an interruption of their lives or physical state that their minds are ill equipped to deal with. Their memories of events before this interruption are often vague or absent. Occasionally, the most unexpected experiences might cause sensations or visions of the past to come rushing back.</p>
            <p class="indent">Rather than sleeping, reborn regularly sit and dwell on the past, hoping for some revelation of what came before. Most of the time, these are dark, silent stretches. Occasionally, though, in a moment of peace, stress, or excitement, a reborn gains a glimpse of what came before. When you desire to have such a dreamlike vision, roll on the Lost Memories table to inspire its details.</p>

			<h4>REBORN IN THE DOMAINS OF DREAD</h4>
			<p>When creating a reborn, consult with your DM to see if it’s appropriate to tie your origins to one of the following Domains of Dread:</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Har’Akir.</strong> You died and endured the burial rites of this desert realm, yet somehow a soul—yours or another’s—has taken refuge in your perfectly preserved remains.</li>
				<li><strong>Kartakass.</strong> You awoke amid the bizarre experiments of an amoral scientist. They consider you their finest creation or have a task for you to fulfill.</li>
				<li><strong>Tepest.</strong> You emerged from the mysterious device known as the Apparatus, your body a lifeless shell and your past a mystery.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>REBORN TRAITS</h4>
			<p>You have the following racial traits.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are a Humanoid.</p>            
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Choose between increasing one ability score by 2 and other by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</p>						
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you gain this lineage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>			
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ancestral Legacy.</em></strong> If you replace a race with this lineage, you can keep the following elements of that race: any skill proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you gained from it.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you don’t keep any of those elements or you choose this lineage at character creation, you gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Deathless Nature.</em></strong> You have escaped death, a fact represented by the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have advantage on saving throws against disease and being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.</li>
                <li>You have advantage on death saving throws.</li>
                <li>You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe.</li>
                <li>You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in an inactive, motionless state, during which you retain consciousness.</li>
            </ul>            
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Knowledge from a Past Life.</em></strong> You temporarily remember glimpses of the past, perhaps faded memories from ages ago or a previous life. When you make an ability check that uses a skill, you can roll a d6 immediately after seeing the number on the d20 and add the number on the d6 to the check. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your pro􀂦ciency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you 􀂦nish a long rest.</p>
