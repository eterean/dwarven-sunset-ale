		<description>
			<p>An ancestor or mentor’s deeds earned them a place in legend. Now it’s your turn. You are the clear inheritor of a famed legacy. You’ve inherited a token from your predecessor, something that marks you as their inheritor, such as a signet ring, signature piece of clothing, or notable weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, any time you reveal your legacy, you swiftly learn the local opinion of your predecessor. If locals have never heard of your predecessor, nothing changes. If they have, rumors of your connection spread swiftly, and many locals consider you either a hero or a threat. Heroes are welcomed and might easily gain an audience with local leaders. Threats are encouraged to leave before they invite danger.</p>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<h5>GENERATIONAL BACKGROUND FEATURES</h5>
				<p>You can use background features to connect characters between campaigns. Characters who have previously adventured in Ravenloft, such as those from a previous <em>Curse of Strahd</em> campaign, make good candidates for beign your new character's mentor or relative. Alternatively, the deed of your characters in past adventures might have impacted your new character, throwing them into action or danger. Whatever details you and your DM decide upon, such connections can forge the continuing legend of a whole family of heroes.</p>
				<p class="indent">If you're interested in exploring this, this Inheritor background feature provides a token that might be passed on from a previous character. Perhaps it's a signature tool, a journal, or a dormant (or misplaced) magic item. Work with your DM to detail this inheritance and how it can factor into future adventures.</p>

			<p>The Mists whisper to you and guide you through their mysterious eddies. You immediately know if an object you’re touching is a Mist talisman (detailed in chapter 3 on the Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft). You recognize where the talisman originates from if you have been to its domain of origin.</p>

		<description>
			<p>After a fateful experience, you believe you’re aligned with spirits and can serve as a conduit for their insights and goals. You have advantage on any Arcana or Religion check you make to remember or research information about spirits and the afterlife. Additionally, you begin your adventuring career with a custom-made device for communing with otherworldly forces, perhaps a spirit board, a tarokka deck, an automatic writing planchette, dowsing rods, a cup for tea leaves, or a device of your own design. Add your pro􀂦ciency bonus to any ability check you make using this type of divining tool.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You survived. Whatever it was, you made it through, and you can help others do the same. People view you as an expert on the traumatic situation you faced—be it a specific sort of violence, illness, or otherwise. You are aware of nonmagical recovery techniques, common resources, and misinformation. You know how to speak to sympathetic doctors, clergy, and local leaders and can convince them to shelter one person (other than yourself) at a modest lifestyle for up to one month.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You come from somewhere else, a place others couldn’t begin to understand. Perhaps your home is a unique corner of the Land of the Mists or another world entirely. In any case, you and other travelers have shared experiences. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among sympathetic trading caravans, itinerant families, or displaced groups, so long as you don’t present yourself as a danger. Such groups will hide you from the law or anyone searching for you, though they won’t risk their lives for you. Additionally, you can tell whether an object you can see and touch is from your homeland with near perfect accuracy.</p>
